# Peep's Adventures
### Summary

A 3D Platformer game, with the main goal of reaching the end of each level, whilst also collecting power ups and fighting enemies. Each level will end in a boss fight, having to be beaten before the player can proceed to the next level.

### Game Goals

The main goal of the game is to reach the end of the level, with the player collecting power ups/fighting enemies. The player can also aim towards completion, meaning they will have to find all the secrets within all the levels.

### Story Synopsis

The main character is a bird who is trying to find his family, who have been kidnapped. The bird’s family has been taken far away, meaning they have to travel through different environments to find them. The main character will also encounter different npc’s, giving them insight into where they have to go.

### Gameplay

The player progresses through the levels, often having to take detours from the obvious route, in order to find power-ups to help get past enemies or to break objects in the way.

The player is able to jump over objects, but sometimes will have to gain a double jump power-up, as sometimes you might need to jump higher. 

The player has the ability to sprint, which in turn will allow the player to jump over bigger gaps, provided they’ve made a big enough run up.
